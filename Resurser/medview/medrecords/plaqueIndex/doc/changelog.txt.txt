COPENHAGEN_DEVELOPMENT (Nils: February-april 2005)

-------
* The requests from Copenhagen:
-------

1. Added support for inputing data with number keys.
2. Added support for deleting input data with delete.
3. Added separator in the middle to make the separation of left/right mouth 
   clearer
4. Added a cursor (highlighting in yellow), so that you now see
   where the next value will appear if you use buttons or number keys to input
   data.
5. "Blödning" should only have the values 0 or 1. Also the cursor did not move in this row.
--
6. Added support for backing through tables with backspace.
7. Extracted teeth are now saved in the same way as Unchecked teeth, but with the value Extracted.
   Before, extracted teeth would not show up in the tree files at all (the terms would be missing).
-------
* Fixed bugs that were discovered during the above work.
-------
1. The order of how the input position moved between the five rows was broken -
   try using the buttons to input values from top to bottom in the old version
   (the input would jump around erratically, and some rows would be skipped
   altogether)
2. When clicking with the mouse on a combobox to input a value, the "cursor" would remain where it
   was before (always going to the Poche input)
3. Fixed the "arrow" icon which would remain after using a combobox to input
   data (which hides what data was actually input)
4. The layout for "Furkaturer" was misaligned. Fixed.
--
5. Tree file saving was broken, as all three columns in a table were saved as <tooth name>f.
   This was corrected, so that they are now saved as <t>df, <t>f and <t>mf.
6. Enter key now moves forward through the tables without making changes. (Before, it would always make
   the cursor move vertically, and loop within the current table)
7. If the value in a cell was 1, and you clicked the mouse and typed 1, you would cycle to the next value
   that begun with 1, i.e. 10, and from 10 it would cycle to 11 and so on.
   Now, the value always becomes 1 if you type 1.
8. To input values 10-15, press shift+ the last number (shift+0 becomes 10, shift+3 becomes 13)
   However, this only works for the normal number keys (on the number pad, shift+numbers become the arrow keys, 
   Home, PgUp etc)

---

Known issues:

* Vertical movement inside Furkaturer behaves differently, due to each tooth being composed by two separate tables
  - getprvTable 

* Requires at least 1024x768 display size to work in medrecords due to layout issues
