<title>java.datahandling package</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides classes for the data layer of MedView.
 The heart of the data handling API is the MedViewDataHandler class which  is a facade for the common  data handling part of the MedView  programs. Core MedView  functionality involving various data and its processing  are kept in the common datahandling packages, while more  application-specific handling should be contained in the  appropriate package structure of that application. 


Detailed contents forthcoming.
